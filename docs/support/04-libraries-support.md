## Libraries in Different Languages

To make things easier for developers, we provide client libraries for different programming languages and caching functionalities.

**Note:** These libraries are externally developed and maintained. Use caution when using libraries in different languages, as some of these resources may be out-of-date.

- **R**
  To help more researchers use CARTO to drive their geospatial data, we have released the R client library. [Fork it on GitHub!](https://github.com/Vizzuality/cartodb-r)

- **Node.js**
  This demo app authenticates with your CARTO and shows how to perform read and write queries using the SQL API. [Fork it on GitHub!](https://github.com/Vizzuality/cartodb-nodejs)

- **PHP**
  The PHP library provides a wrapper around the SQL API to get PHP objects straight from SQL calls to CARTO. [Fork it on GitHub!](https://github.com/Vizzuality/cartodbclient-php)

- **Python**
  CARTO provides access to the SQL API through [CARTOframes](https://github.com/cartodb/cartoframes/), a package built with data scientists in mind, and [CARTO Python SDK](https://github.com/cartodb/carto-python/), built to support application development. Install cartoframes with `pip install cartoframes` and the SDK with `pip install carto`.

- **Java**
  Very basic example of how to access CARTO SQL API. [Fork it on GitHub!](https://github.com/cartodb/cartodb-java-client)

- **.NET**
  .NET library for authenticating with CARTO using an API Key, based on work started by [The Data Republic](http://www.thedatarepublic.com/). [Fork it on GitHub!](https://github.com/thedatarepublic/CartoDBClientDotNET)

- **Clojure**
  Clojure library for authenticating with CARTO, maintained by [REDD Metrics](http://www.reddmetrics.com/). [Fork it on GitHub!](https://github.com/reddmetrics/cartodb-clj)

- **iOS**
  Objective-C library for interacting with CARTO in native iOS applications. [Fork it on GitHub!](https://github.com/jmnavarro/cartodb-objectivec-client)

- **Golang**
  A Go client for the CARTO SQL API that supports authentication using an API key. [Fork it on GitHub!](https://github.com/agonzalezro/cartodb_go)
